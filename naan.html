    <h3>Steps: Naan</h3>
    <ol>1. Gather the ingredients.</ol>
    <ol><p>2.
        Add the dry yeast and sugar to the warm water and stir till the yeast is dissolved. Cover and leave aside for 10 minutes
        or until the mixture begins to froth. This indicates the yeast is active. Keep aside.
    </p></ol>
    <ol>3. Mix the flour and salt to taste and sift through a very fine sieve into a large mixing bowl.</ol>
    <ol>4. Next, add the yeast mixture, 3 tablespoons of ghee, and all the yogurt. Use your fingertips to mix all this into a soft
    dough.</ol>
    <ol>5. Once mixed, flour a clean, flat surface, and knead the dough till it is smooth and stretchy.</ol>
    <ol><p>6.
        Grease a large bowl with a few drops of vegetable oil and put the dough in it. Cover with cling wrap and allow to rest
        for about 90 minutes or till the dough doubles in volume.
    </p></ol>
    <ol>7. Punch the dough down and knead again for 10 minutes.</ol>
    <ol>8. Equally, divide the dough and roll between your palms to form 8 round balls.</ol>
    <ol><p>9.
        Lightly flour the same surface on which you kneaded the dough and roll out each ball until you have a circle, 7 to 8
        inches in diameter (1/4-inch thick). Gently pull on one edge of the circle to form the naan into a teardrop shape. Do
        not pull too hard or you may tear the dough. Instead of rolling the dough out (with a rolling pin) you can also pat it
        into a circle with your hands.
    </p></ol>
    <ol><p>10.
        Preheat oven 400 F / 200 C / Mark 6. Lay a piece of aluminum foil â€‹on an oven tray (to cover) and grease it lightly with
        a few drops of vegetable oil.
    </p></ol>
    <ol>11. Place as many formed dough balls as will fit without touching each other on the tray.</ol>
    <ol>12. Brush each dough ball lightly with ghee, and sprinkle a pinch of onion seeds evenly over the surface.</ol>
    <ol>13. Place the tray in the oven and cook till the naan begins to puff out and lightly brown. Flip the naan and repeat.</ol>
    <ol>14. Remove from oven and serve hot in a foil-lined basket.</ol>
