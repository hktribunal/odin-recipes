    <h3>Steps: Kofta</h3>
    <ol>1. Gather the ingredients.</ol>
    <ol>2. Wash, peel, and dice the potatoes.</ol>
    <ol>3. Boil them in a pot of water until fork tender.</ol>
    <ol>4. Drain and set aside.</ol>
    <ol>5. Next, boil the veggies until crisp-tender.</ol>
    <ol>6. Drain and set aside.</ol>
    <ol>7. In a large bowl, mash the boiled potatoes, mixed vegetables, paneer, and cream together.</ol>
    <ol>8. Add the kofta spices - cumin, coriander, and red chili powder - to this mash and mix well. The resulting dough should be
    firm. If not add some more boiled potato. Season with salt.</ol>
    <ol>9. In a small bowl, combine the chopped nuts and raisins.</ol>
    <ol>10. Make this dough into balls and put a 1/2 teaspoon of the nut and raisin mix in the center of each ball.</ol>
    <ol>11. Roll into perfect rounds.</ol>
    <ol>12. In a large pot, heat the oil kept aside to fry the koftas, on a medium flame.</ol>
    <ol>13. Deep fry these rounds till pale golden in color.</ol>
    <ol>14. Drain on paper towels and keep aside.</ol>
    <br>
    <h3>Steps: Sauce</h3>
    <ol>1. Gather the ingredients.</ol>
    <ol>2. Heat the 3 tablespoons of oil in a deep pan and fry the onions till light brown.</ol>
    <ol>3. In a small food processor, place the fried onions, tomatoes, ginger, garlic, coriander, cumin, and red chili powder, and
    grind into a paste.</ol>
    <ol>4. Put this paste back into the pan and fry till the oil begins to separate from the masala.</ol>
    <ol>5. Add the poppy seeds powder and nut paste and fry for another 2 to 3 minutes.</ol>
    <ol>6. Add 1 cup of warm water (the sauce for this dish is meant to be thick so do not add too much water) to this masala to
    form a gravy. Mix well. Season with salt.</ol>
    <ol>7. Bring the gravy to a boil and then reduce the fire to a simmer.</ol>
    <ol>8. Gently add the koftas to this gravy and cook uncovered for 2 to 3 minutes.</ol>
    <ol>9. Turn off the fire and sprinkle the garam masala all over the top of the dish.</ol>
    <ol>10. Cover immediately and allow to sit for 5 minutes.</ol>
    <ol>11. Serve with hot naans (tandoor-baked leavened Indian flatbread) or jeera rice.</ol>
